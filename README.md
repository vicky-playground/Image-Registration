08/20: 
- The perturbed model is struggling to learn the patterns in the data, leading to a poor fit.

Next Step:
- Reduce perturbation scale and bounds
- Experiment with other optimizers (gradients first)
- Lower learning rate

Goal:
- need less running time to get a better/same result when using perturbation to a 2 or so hidden layers only.

Future: 
- Adaptive perturbation from larger scale to smaller scale
